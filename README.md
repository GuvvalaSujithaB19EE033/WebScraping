# Web Scraping Assignment

This repository contains my assignment on web scraping, where I extracted job listings for the keyword "Python developer" from Indeed.com.

## Folders

The `Assignment` folder is organized into three subfolders:

### 1. Web_Scraping

In the `Web_Scraping` folder, you'll find the code used for scraping job listings from Indeed.com. The main script is `scraping.py`.

#### scraping.py

This Python script uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape job listings from Indeed.com. It searches for "Python developer" job listings, extracts relevant information, and saves the data to a ans.csv file.

### 2. MongoDb

The `MongoDb` folder might contain code related to storing scraped data in a MongoDB database (if applicable).

### 3. Django

The `Django` folder might contain code related to integrating the scraped data into a Django web application (if applicable).

## Usage

To run the web scraping script and extract job listings:

1. Navigate to the `Web_Scraping` folder.
2. Run the `scraping.py` script using your preferred Python interpreter.
3. The scraped job listings will be saved to the `ans.csv` file in the same directory.

## Notes

- Make sure you have the required libraries installed, such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup, before running the script.
- This is a basic example and might not cover all details of the assignment.

Feel free to explore the subfolders and files in this repository to learn more about how the web scraping assignment was completed.
